$PARAMO$ pipeline requires three initial pieces of data: character matrix, dated phylogeny, and anatomy ontology. Herein, we use a of 9 characters and 87 species from the large-scale phylogeny of Hymenoptera [@sharkey2012phylogenetic], this dataset was slightly modified for the demonstrative purpose. For reconstructing character histories, we use the dated phylogeny of [@klopfstein2013hymenopteran], and for characters-ontology linking, we use Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology [HAO [@yoder2010gross]]. In this demonstration, we are interested in constructing the amalgamated characters for the three leveles of amalgamation (=anatomical hierarchy): anatomical dependecies (ADs), body regions (BRs) and entire phenotype (EF). At the BR level, three main body regions are considered -- "head", "legs" and "wings". 


# STEP 1. Initial character matrix
Our initial character matrix consists of a sample of 9 characters. The nexus file of the intial matrix can be found at `STEP_1/Step1_matrix.nex` and viewed using, for example, [Mesquite](http://www.mesquiteproject.org). Below, in describing characters, the follwoing notation is used $C_\#\{S_1,S_2,...\}$ where $C_\#$ stands for a character ID and $S_1, S_2, ...$ stand for character states. Let us have a look at the character report.

```{r table, echo=FALSE}
CH<-read.csv(file="STEP_1/Char_info.csv", header = T, as.is=T, check.names=F)

kable(CH[,c(1:6)],  booktabs=TRUE,
      caption = 'Initial characters obtained at Step 1. ')%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, font_size=8, latex_options="hold_position") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
  column_spec(6, width = "10em") %>%
  footnote(c("ID - character ID in this study.",
    "IDR*- character ID in Sharkey et al. (2012)."))
```

 Note, the two pairs of characters in the matrix  $\{C_2, C_3\}$ and $\{C_5, C_6\}$ are subjected to anatomical dependencies.
 
* $C_2\{0,1\}$ is hierrachically (anatomically) dependent on $C_3\{0\}$. This dependecy is indicated by $<$ or $>$ depending on the direction of the dependecy. The hierrachical dependecy means that states $C_2\{0,1\}$ appear immediately as $C_3$ swithches to the state $C_3\{0\}$.
* $C_5$ and $C_6$ are subjected to synchronous changes, which means tha the states of this characters are mutually exclusive and hence dependent because one trait is coded using absent/present coding. The synchronous dpenedecy is indicated as $<>$; the notation $C_5\{0,1\}<>C_6\{1,0\}$ means -- if $C_5$ is $\{0\}$ then $C_6$ is $\{0\}$, and if $C_5$ is $\{1\}$ then $C_6$ is $\{1\}$.


# Step 2. Incorporating anatomical dependencies: constructing amalgamations at the AD level

The two pairs of anatomically depenent characters -- $C_2$, $C_3$ and $C_5$, $C_6$ have to be apropriately amalgamated into single characters to adeuqtely model the dependecies. The amalgamation produces the following two characters (see the text in the article):

* $C_3 \oplus C_2=C_{3,2}\{00,01,10,11\}$. $C_\{3,2\}$  is coded in the matrix as  $C_{3,2}\{0\&1,0\&1,2,3\}$.

* $C_5$ and $C_6$ are combinded into $C_\{5,6\}$. The synchronous dependency between these characters has to be eliminated that gives the character $C_{5,6}$ without changing the state pattern.

The recoding of dependent characters constructs the amalgamated characters at the AD level. If a character does not display any dependencies then we treat it as correctly amalgamated at the AD level by default. Let's have a look at the new character report.
```{r}
CH2<-read.csv(file="STEP_2/Char_info_step_2.csv", header = T, as.is=T, check.names=F)

kable(CH2, booktabs=TRUE,
      caption = 'Characters recoded for the AD level amalgamation (Step 2).')%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, font_size=8, latex_options="hold_position") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
  column_spec(6, width = "5em") %>%
  column_spec(7, width = "5em") %>%
  footnote(c("ID - character ID in this study.",
    "IDR*- character ID in Sharkey et al. (2012)."))
```

The new matrix of the recoded characters can be found in `STEP_2/Step2_matrix.nex` and `STEP_2/matrix.csv`. Here is the part of this matrix.

```{r}
# characters matrix
MT<-read.csv("STEP_4/matrix.csv", header = T, row.names=1, as.is=T, check.names=F)
kable(MT[c(1:10),], booktabs=TRUE,
      caption = 'Characters matrix obtained at Step 2.')%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, font_size=8, latex_options="hold_position")
```


# STEP 3. Linking anatomical characters with ontology

Having initial characters properly coded to account for the anatomical dependecies, let's move on character-ontology linking. The table below shows the Hymenoptera characters linked 
with the terms of Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology [HAO](http://portal.hymao.org/projects/32/public/ontology/). This table will be used in \textit{"Retrieve all characters"} ($RAC$) query that retrives all characters asscoaited with an input ontology term.
```{r}
AN<-read.csv(file="STEP_3/Char_annotation.csv", header = T, as.is=T, check.names=F)
kable(AN, booktabs=TRUE,
      caption = 'Characters linked with HAO terms (Step 3).')%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, font_size=8, latex_options="hold_position")
```

To run $RAC$, we use `ontologyIndex` package and a set of preccoked `R` functions located in `R_PARAMO/PARAMO_functions.R`. For our demonstrative purposes $RAC$ is supposed to work with the BR and EF levels of the amalgamation. So, let's test our query for BR ("head", "wings" and "legs") and EF terms. First of all, we need to make character-ontology to be a part of the  ontolgy graph.
```{r}
library("ontologyIndex")
source("R_PARAMO/PARAMO_functions.R")

# opening HAO file ("BFO:0000050" is part_of relatinship)
ONT<-get_OBO("STEP_3/HAO.obo", extract_tags="everything", propagate_relationships = c("BFO:0000050", "is_a"))

# let's create  "annot" list of anotations from the annotation table
char_id<-paste0("CHAR:", AN$ID2)
annot<-set_names(table2list(AN[,c(2,4)]), char_id)

# next we make the annotations to be the part of the ontology object ONT
ONT$terms_selected_id<-annot
```

Now, we can construct and query the vectors of HAO terms that correspond to the focal BRs and EF. We will use the results of this query at Step 5.
```{r}
# BR level, HAO terms
levelBR<-set_names(c("HAO:0000397", "HAO:0001089", "HAO:0000494"), 
                   c("head", "wings", "legs") )

# EF level, HAO terms
levelEF<-set_names(c("HAO:0000012"), 
                   c("whole_organism") )

# we use get_descendants_chars to get the set of all anatomcal characters that descend from a particular HAO term, for example:
#get_descendants_chars(ONT, annotations="manual", terms="HAO:0000012")

# now we can use RAC query for the BR and EF levels using the ontology
#BR level
BR<-lapply(levelBR, function(x)
  get_descendants_chars(ONT, annotations="manual", terms=x)  )
cat("BR LEVEL\n")
BR

#EF level
EF<-lapply(levelEF, function(x)
  get_descendants_chars(ONT, annotations="manual", terms=x)  )
cat("EF LEVEL\n")
EF
```


# STEP 4. Inference: linking characters with models and tree

At this step, we need to construct data files for analysing the set of our seven individual characters (obtained at Step 2) using RevBayes. The three files have to be created for each character: (1) chraracter file `.char` (`STEP_4/RevBayes/data/`), (2) RevBayes script `.Rev` (`STEP_4/RevBayes/`), and (3) tree file `.tre` that is shared accross all chracters (`STEP_4/RevBayes/data/`). The process of file cretion can be automitized using the following scripts.
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# reading chracter matrix
MT<-read.csv("STEP_4/matrix.csv", header = T, row.names=1, as.is=T, check.names=F)

# creating chracter files using the matrix
#setwd("~/Documents/Recon-Anc_Anat/Supplementary_materials/STEP_4/RevBayes/data")
for (i in 1:ncol(MT))
{
  C.rev<-MT[,i]
  C.rev<-gsub("&", " ", C.rev)
  
  out<-cbind(rownames(MT), C.rev)
  write.table(file=paste0(colnames(MT[i]), ".char"), out, quote=F, sep=" ", 
              row.names=F, col.names=F)
}

# write Rev file for the two-state characters
#setwd("~/Documents/Recon-Anc_Anat/Supplementary_materials/STEP_4/RevBayes/")

# For constructing .Rev files we use the procooked template "PARAMO2_templ.Rev"
fl.in  <- readLines("PARAMO2_templ.Rev")

for (i in 1:ncol(MT))
{
  fl.in  <- readLines("PARAMO2_templ.Rev")
  fl.in  <- gsub(pattern = "@analysis_name@", replace = paste0(colnames(MT[i])),
                 x = fl.in)
  fl.in <- gsub(pattern = "@chrs_2_read@", replace = paste0("data/", colnames(MT[i]), ".char"), x = fl.in)
  
  cat(file=paste0(colnames(MT[i]), ".Rev"), sep="\n", fl.in)

}

# write Rev file for dependent four-state character C3-2
setwd("~/Documents/Recon-Anc_Anat/Supplementary_materials")


# I use precooked set of functions for constracting SMM from Tarasov (2019)
source("R_PARAMO/SMM_functions.R")

###################################
# same SMMs as for the tail color problem
###################################
char.state<-c("a", "p")
rate.param<-c(1, 1)
TL<-init_char_matrix(char.state, rate.param, diag.as=0)
char.state<-c("r", "b")
rate.param<-c(1, 1)
COL<-init_char_matrix(char.state, rate.param, diag.as=0)

#SMM-ind
TC.ind<-comb2matrices(TL, COL, controlling.state=NULL, name.sep="", diag.as="")
TC.ind
in.rev<-Mk_Rev(TC.ind)
cat(in.rev) # COPY the output and insert in Rev template PARAMO2_templ.Rev
#cat(in.rev, file="STEP_4/input_Rev.txt") # or save this outout to a file and then copy to Rev template
```

Now having created the files for the inference, we run RevBayes. Each RevBayes output consists of four files located in `STEP_4/RevBayes/output/`: log file, ancestral character state reconstruction (asr), and stochastim maps (stm).

Before starting ontology-informed amalgamation of characters, let us first fix potential issues with data maipulation. To amalgamate stochastic maps, we first have to descriteze them -- each tree branch is split into small bins, whereas each bin indicates the state of a charatcer. This dicretization facilitates stochastic map amalgamation but may critically increseas memory usage in `R` (if map samples and trees are large). To make the memory usage efficient, we put each stochastic map in a seprate `.rds` file, then we put all `.rds` files belonging to the same character into a seprate `.zip` archive. This trick prevents `R` to collapse and, at the same time, allows getting access to the individual maps upon demand. You may want to skip this substep and proceed directly to the next step dealiang with amalgamation of the stochastic maps (the `.zip` archives obtained at this substep are in `STEP_4/RevBayes/Discr_maps`).

```{r eval=FALSE}

                        save = NULL) %>% read.simmap(text=., format="phylip")

# STEP 5. Ontology-informed amalgamation of the stochastic maps

Now having the stochastic maps in the proper format, we can start with their ontology-informed amalgamation. Our goal is to construct the amalgamated characters for the AD, BR and EF levels of anatomical hierarchy. The AD level exibits the individual stochastic maps obtained at the previous step (`STEP_4/RevBayes/Discr_maps`). At this step, we will constrauct characters for BR and EF levels using ontology-informed amalgamatiion of the stochastic maps.  Remeber that, at the BR level,  we considered three main body regions -- "head", "legs" and "wings". The stochstic map amalagantion is done using the results of the $RAC$ query from Step 3.


```{r results='hide'}
source("R_PARAMO/Functions_Stack_maps.R")

# dir to write and read files
dirW= ("STEP_5/Discr_maps/")
dirR= ("STEP_4/RevBayes/output/")
#############
# Amalgamation at the BR level
#############
# we use the ouput `BR` from the RAC query obtained at Step 3. 
# This ouput contains character IDs for BR terms
# Let's rename those IDs to match the file names of the stochastic maps
cc<-lapply(BR, function(x) sub("CHAR:", "C", x) )
cc<-lapply(cc, function(x) sub(",", "-", x) )

# creating BR.maps to store the amalagamations
BR.maps<-vector("list", length(BR))
names(BR.maps)<-names(BR)

# run amalgamation using the renamed outputs from RAC query
# this loop construct one amalgamation for each BR term
# the number of amalgamations per term can be specified using `ntrees=`
for (i in 1:length(BR.maps))
{
  map<-paramo(cc[[i]], ntrees=1, dirW=dirW)
  BR.maps[[i]]<-map
}

#############
# Amalgamation at the EF level
#############
# we use the ouput `EF` from the RAC query obtained at Step 3. 
# This ouput contains character IDs for EF term
# Let's rename those IDs to match the file names of the stochastic maps
cc3<-lapply(EF, function(x) sub("CHAR:", "C", x) )
cc3<-lapply(cc3, function(x) sub(",", "-", x) )

# creating EF.maps to store the amalagamations
EF.maps<-vector("list", length(EF))
names(EF.maps)<-names(EF)

# run amalgamation using the renamed outputs from RAC query
# this code will return 10 amalgamated stochastic maps of the EF character
for (i in 1:length(EF.maps))
{
  map<-paramo(cc3[[i]], ntrees=10, dirW=dirW)
  EF.maps[[i]]<-map
}


```

Now let us plot the amalgamated character hostories for BR and EF characters.

```{r}
library("phytools")

#########
# BR level
########

# plot one stochastic maps for the head character
plotSimmap(BR.maps$head[[1]], pts=F,ftype="off", ylim=c(0,100) )
title("\n Head character")

# plot one stochastic maps for the wings character
plotSimmap(BR.maps$wings[[1]], pts=F,ftype="off", ylim=c(0,100) )
title("\n Wings character")

# plot one stochastic maps for the legs character
plotSimmap(BR.maps$legs[[1]], pts=F,ftype="off", ylim=c(0,100) )
title("\n Legs character")


#########
# EF level
#########

# plot one stochastic maps for the entire phenotype character
# first, let's define color pallette for the characters sonce it contains many states
library("RColorBrewer")
tmm<-EF.maps$whole_organism[[1]]
lapply(tmm$maps, names) %>% unlist %>% unique->states
# number of states in the character
#length(states)

hm.palette <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, 'Set1'), space='Lab')
color<-hm.palette(length(states))

plotSimmap(tmm, setNames(color, states),  lwd=3, pts=F,ftype="off", ylim=c(0,100))
title("\n Entire Phenotype character")
```
